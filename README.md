The elkd platform æ­·

Elkd is a distributed, time series database designed for analysing billions of events.  It is eventually consistent and is backed by the Raft protocol. 

Elkd has a powerful functional query language built in that is optimised for aggregating streams consisting of billions of events.  It is fault tolerant and highly available. We have a comprehensive real-world simulation testing suite that we continuously update to battle test the core runtime.  This ensures we maintain and improve reliability between releases.
