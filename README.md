**Ravine** is a distributed event-streaming server built for the modern day.  It is robust, lightweight and super fast!
- **Produce/Consume** - create Topics, then produce and consume them.
- **Process** - create processors that transform or aggregate event data, and project new Streams with the outputs.
- **Distribute** - scale & balance your event processors across your cluster.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **JDK 8** or above.

### Installing

Using the gradle wrapper, you can now run.

```bash
./gradlew installDist
```

This will produce a bin file `ravine` under `./core/build/install/ravine/bin`

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests

You can run unit tests as part of a build:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Or, you can run them specifically:

```bash
./gradlew test [--tests <some-package>|<regex>|<class-name>]
```

It is just vanilla Gradle so you can refer to the docs for more usages.  If you use Jetbrains IDEA, you can also run the tests within the editor.

## Coding Style

Kotlin is our core language and we currently enforce styling via `ktlint`.  `ktlint` will run automatically on a build task.

Andz can also run it directly:

```bash
./gradlew ktlint
```

And have the formatting done for you:

```bash
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

## Use Cases

There are numerous uses for event-streaming, here are just a few thing you could use **Ravine** for:

- Define a Topic of UI Events (PageView, PageScroll, PageSwipe, ButtonClick, TextInput, etc) to analyze customer interaction with your product, to gain insights and optimize your critical customer flows.
- Perform time-series analysis on all kinds of application event streams.
- Create app/system audit streams for retrospective analysis for fraud or unauthorized access use-cases.
- Natively supports [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) Architectures
